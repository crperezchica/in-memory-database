In Memory Database Store
===

## Description:

Create an in-memory (not persisted to file system, it will "disappear" when process ends and memory is reclaimed) 
database library that provides an interface to store (manage via CRUD) objects.

Standard repository/dev stuff: README, package.json, travis-ci, tests, meaningful commits, named npm scripts, etc.

* Setup scripts so that `npm test` runs linting

## Testing

Use TDD to drive the implementation. Think about the tests in terms of behavior, not implementation: If I store
an object, it is because I want to retrieve it, not because I want to know how the store manages saving the object.

## Requirements/Guidelines

* Use `npm` to find a package for generating id's.
* Should be able to create separate instances of the store (not global)
* Use a `class` to provide for "creating" separate store instances

Your store should offer the following methods:

* `.save(<objectToSave>)`
  * creates an `_id` property on the object
  * returns `objectToSave` with added `_id` property
* `.get(<id>)`
  * returns the object that has that id
  * return `null` if that id does not exist
* `.getAll()`
  * returns array of all objects
  * return empty array `[]` when no objects
  * do **not** return the underlying array //We want a copy of the array
* `.remove(<id>)`
  * removes the object from the store that has that id
  * return `{ removed: true }` if the object was removed, else return `{ removed: false }` if the 
  object did not exist
  

## Advanced/Bonus:

* Use something other than `.find` to more efficiently retrieve object by id. Can be an object as a dictionary, or checkout `Map` to "index" objects by `_id`. 
You'll need to also access as a list, so think about both usages.
* Add `.update(<objectToUpdate>)`
  * reads the `_id` property from the object (error if it is not found):
  ```js
  const id = objectToUpdate._id;
  if(!id) throw new Error('Expected object to have an _id property');
  ```
  * saves the provided object as the new version of the object
  * returns `objectToUpdate`
